# Vigen-re-cipher
Just a small project, just for fun

## How to use:  
Upper textbox is for plaintext  
Lower textbox is for ciphertext  
Press encryt button to encryt the text in plaintext textbox  

`Generate key` botton creates a key text file in key folder, the key generated is 256 characters long

Default key location is `key.txt` in `key` folder, you need to press `generate key` for creating it  
You can select another key by pressing `import key` button

This cipher can encryt characters in ASCII, but not included end of line, new line, tab and other ASCII code which can't normally display

Therefore, if there is multiple lines in plaintext textbox, there will be exact same line in ciphertext and exact same characters in each line
